•	I would recommend the above top 10 zip codes because in those zip code areas the number of customers who have agreed to use Block for their renovation is much greater than the number of potential customers who have completed the online survey on Block’s website. Therefore, I would recommend the Growth team to launch a new marketing campaign in those 10 zip code areas because the rate is much higher in those areas compared to others.
